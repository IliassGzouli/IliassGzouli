# Hi, I'm Iliass  
### Aspiring Data Engineer | Python & ETL Developer

I build structured data pipelines and analytical projects using Python and modern data engineering practices.

Currently focusing on:
- Designing modular ETL pipelines  
- Implementing Data Quality Checks  
- Orchestrating workflows with Apache Airflow  
- Building clean and reproducible data systems
